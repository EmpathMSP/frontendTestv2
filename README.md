# Frontend Developer Challenge 🚀

Welcome to our frontend developer coding challenge! We're excited to see how you approach this task and how you structure reusable, well-architected components in **React 18**.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Your task is to **recreate specific sections** of the provided **Figma design** using **React 18, TypeScript, and ShadCN**.

We’re looking for:  
✅ **Reusable and modular components**  
✅ **Type-safe code with TypeScript**  
✅ **Style with ShadCN**

### 🎨 Figma Design  

🔗 **[View the Design](https://www.figma.com/design/cWIJNVUPDFGNOfA2DCd3Mv/Coding-Challenge-Jan-25?node-id=0-1)**  

### ⏳ Minimum Requirements

You **do not** need to build the entire page! Please complete at least:

1. **The Navbar**  
2. **The top row of "What’s Next" cards**  
3. **The right-hand progress graph**  

If you have extra time, feel free to build out additional parts of the UI, but the focus should be on **clean, modular, reusable components**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Mandatory)

- **React 18** (Functional components, hooks)  
- **TypeScript** (Strict typing required)  
- **ShadCN** for UI components and styling  
- **Component-based architecture**  

## 📌 Requirements  

1. **Recreate the Required UI Elements**  
   - Use **ShadCN** for styling and components.  
   - Ensure **reusability** in your component structure.  
   - Accept **dynamic values via props** for flexibility.  

2. **Write Clean, Type-Safe Code**  
   - **Strict TypeScript types** (no `any`).  
   - **Meaningful component names** and file structures.  

3. **Make it Responsive**  
   - The UI should work well on **both desktop and mobile**.  

4. **Use Git & Version Control**  
   - Create a **GitHub repository** for your project.  
   - Push your code and **share the repo link** when done.  

## 🚀 Bonus Points  

- **Animations & Interactivity**  
- **State management (React Context, Zustand, etc.)**  
- **Adding unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library)**
- **Building more than min requirements**

## 📤 Submission  

1. **Fork this repository** (or create your own).  
2. **Implement your solution** following the requirements.  
3. **Push your code** to GitHub and share the repo link with us.  

We look forward to reviewing your work! Happy coding! 🎉
